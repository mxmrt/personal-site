Yes — roll your own. And it’s much easier than it sounds. Cloudflare Pages is free, with unlimited bandwidth, global CDN, and automatic SSL. You can literally upload a zip of HTML files and have a live site in minutes — no build step needed for static content. It also integrates with GitHub so every push auto-deploys.
The workflow would be: keep a GitHub repo with your HTML articles, use a lightweight static site generator (or even just a hand-rolled index page) to create a table of contents, and Cloudflare Pages deploys it automatically on every commit. Each “article” is its own self-contained HTML file — exactly like what we’ve been building. You get a free yourname.pages.dev domain immediately, and you can add a custom domain for the cost of the domain registration alone.

Synthesized Cloudflare Pages deployment strategy for static site hosting
Synthesized Cloudflare Pages deployment strategy for static site hosting


Great, you're ready to go! That's exactly the approach — simple, fast, and you own everything.

Where do you want to start? A few directions we could take right now:

Site structure & landing page — I can build you a clean index page with your bio, links to articles, podcast, monographs, etc.
Article template — A reusable HTML template styled for your long-form pieces so every article looks consistent
Full starter repo — Both of the above plus a GitHub-ready folder structure you can zip and deploy to Cloudflare Pages immediately
What's the vibe you're going for design-wise? Something minimal and academic, something more editorial/magazine-feel, or something else entirely? And do you have a domain in mind yet?

Here's your site — click the About and Articles tabs in the preview to see both views. What you've got:

index.html — Single-page site with hash routing between About and Articles. Dark theme, gold accent, Newsreader serif + DM Sans. The About tab has your bio and social links. The Articles tab has a clean list layout with dates, tags, and excerpts. I put in three placeholder articles based on your actual work.

articles/template.html — Drop-in template for individual articles. Full prose styling with support for code blocks, blockquotes, images, all the formatting you'd need for technical writing.

README.md — Deploy instructions. The workflow is: copy the template, write your article, add a link in the index, push to GitHub, Cloudflare auto-deploys.

A few things you'll want to customize — your actual LinkedIn/GitHub/podcast URLs, email address, and swap the placeholder articles for real ones. Want to tweak anything on the design — colors, layout, bio copy?

My name is Max Martinelli so can you remove the reference to Max Greenberg

Can we remove the MG in the top left - no initials 

can we center the "About" and "Articles" and make the bubbles a bit wider and maybe the font larger. Can we also move the linkedin and podcast buttons to the top next to these buttons? Lets have a button for apple and a button for Spotify separately.  You'll have to find the Almost Nowhere links. 

Then get rid of the github and email buttons. Get rid of the copyright stuff and reference to Max Green Berg.

Apple Podcasts → podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/almost-nowhere/id1796216962
Removed GitHub button, email button, footer/copyright
One thing to double-check — the LinkedIn URL is set to linkedin.com/in/maxmartinelli/. If your actual handle is different, you'll want to swap that out. Want to tweak anything else?

Identified straightforward GitHub setup query for deployment

Yep. On GitHub:

Create a new repo (e.g. maxmartinelli.com or personal-site — name doesn't matter for Cloudflare)
Upload the three files keeping the folder structure (index.html at the root, template.html inside an articles/ folder, README.md at the root)
Push to main
Then on Cloudflare:

Go to pages.cloudflare.com → Create a project → Connect to Git
Select your new repo
Leave the build settings blank (no framework, no build command, no output directory)
Deploy
You'll get a your-project.pages.dev URL immediately. From there you can add a custom domain in the Cloudflare dashboard if you want. Every future push to main auto-deploys.

Want me to walk you through it in your browser?

is there a way to upload all these files through the UI of the website

Feb 17

Confirmed browser-based file upload capability and considered offering guidance
Confirmed browser-based file upload capability and considered offering guidance


Yes — on GitHub's web UI you can drag and drop files when creating a repo. The one catch is it doesn't preserve folder structure from a drag-and-drop of multiple files. Easiest approach:

Create a new repo on github.com (click the + → New repository)
Once created, click "uploading an existing file" on the empty repo page
Drag in index.html and README.md → commit
Then click Add file → Create new file, type articles/template.html as the filename (the slash auto-creates the folder), and paste in the template contents
Alternatively — want me to zip everything up so you can just extract it locally and push it? Or I can walk you through it live in your browser if you want.

it didn't unpack the zip..

Yeah, GitHub doesn't unzip files — it uploads the zip as-is. Want me to do it through your browser right now? I can create the repo and upload the files directly.

Formulated step-by-step instructions for file management
Formulated step-by-step instructions for file management

In your repo, click on the zip file to open it
Click the trash can icon (top right of the file view) to delete it
Click Commit changes
Now to upload the actual files:

From the repo root, click Add file → Upload files
Drag in index.html and README.md → Commit
Back at the repo root, click Add file → Create new file
In the filename field, type articles/template.html — the slash will auto-create the articles folder
Open your template.html file in a text editor, copy the entire contents, and paste it into the editor on GitHub
Click Commit changes
You should end up with index.html and README.md at the root, and template.html inside articles/. Want me to do it in your browser instead?

Can you get rid of the fake articles in the articles tab and have the first one go to:

Diagnosed misconfigured project setup causing deployment failure

It looks like Cloudflare set it up as a Workers project instead of a Pages static site. In the Cloudflare dashboard:

Go to your project's Settings → Build & deployments
Make sure Framework preset is set to None
Build command should be empty (blank)
Build output directory should be / (just a forward slash)
Save and redeploy
If that doesn't work, it might be easier to delete this project and recreate it — when Cloudflare asks you to choose between Workers and Pages, make sure you pick Pages.

Diagnosed UI navigation issue and prepared guidance

It might be under a different path depending on the Cloudflare UI version. Try this:

Go to Workers & Pages in the left sidebar
Click on your project name
Look for a Settings tab at the top
Then look for Builds & Deployments or Build configuration
If you're not seeing it, the simplest fix is probably to delete this project entirely and start fresh — this time making sure you select Pages (not Workers) when creating it. Cloudflare has been merging the two UIs and it's easy to accidentally end up in Workers mode.

That's the problem — it's using npx wrangler deploy which is for Workers, not static Pages. Try this:

Clear the Deploy command field (delete npx wrangler deploy, leave it blank)
Clear the Non-production branch deploy command field too (leave blank)
Keep Path as /
Save and trigger a redeploy
If it still won't let you blank out the deploy command, I'd recommend deleting this project entirely and recreating it — making sure you pick Pages (not Workers) at the start. The newer Cloudflare dashboard merges them and it's easy to end up on the wrong one.

it says deploy command is required

Diagnosed project misconfiguration and devised corrective solution


Yeah, that confirms it was created as a Workers project. Best to start fresh:

Delete this project (should be in Settings → General → Delete)
Go back to Workers & Pages
Click Create → look for a Pages tab or option (not Workers)
Connect your GitHub repo
When it asks for build settings, set Framework preset to None, leave Build command blank, and set Build output directory to /
Deploy
The key is making sure you're creating a Pages project, not a Workers one. The Cloudflare UI can be confusing about this — there should be a toggle or tab at the top when creating a new project.

The only option is create application

Investigated Cloudflare configuration solutions for static asset deployment
Investigated Cloudflare configuration solutions for static asset deployment





Cloudflare has merged the UI. Easiest fix — just add a wrangler.jsonc file to your GitHub repo that tells it to serve your static files. The error message actually told us exactly what it needs.

In GitHub, click Add file → Create new file, name it wrangler.jsonc, and paste this:

json
{
  "name": "max-martinelli-site",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-02-18",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./"
  }
}
Commit it, and the deploy should trigger automatically and work this time. The "directory": "./" tells it to serve everything in your repo as static files — which is exactly what we want.

ok so what do we do now in cloudflare

Feb 17

It should have automatically triggered a new deploy when you committed that file. Go back to your project in Cloudflare and check if there's a new deployment running or completed. If it succeeded, you'll see a .pages.dev URL you can click to see your live site.

If it didn't auto-trigger, look for a Retry deployment or Redeploy button on the latest failed deployment.

Diagnosed DNS configuration issue with domain routing

You need to update your domain's DNS records to point to Cloudflare. Wherever you registered the domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.):

Go to your domain's DNS settings
Add a CNAME record:
Name/Host: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value/Target: personal-site.pages.dev (whatever your .pages.dev URL is)
If you also want www, add another CNAME:
Name/Host: www

Your domain is on Squarespace and currently pointing to Squarespace's servers. You need to change it to point to Cloudflare. Here's what to do:

First, remove the old Squarespace forwarding records:

Under Squarespace Domain Forwarding, delete the @ A record (198.49.23.144) and the www CNAME (ext-sq.squarespace.com)
Then, under Custom records, click ADD RECORD and add:

Host: @
Type: CNAME
Data: personal-site.pages.dev (or whatever your exact .pages.dev URL is)
And add another:

Host: www
Type: CNAME
Data: personal-site.pages.dev
Leave the MX records alone — those are for email. The * wildcard CNAME and the _domainconnect one can stay too, they won't cause issues.

It may take a few minutes to an hour to propagate after saving. What's your .pages.dev URL?

shouldn't this sync up with cloudflare

Feb 17

Examined manual DNS configuration versus automatic synchronization options
Examined manual DNS configuration versus automatic synchronization options



No, it won't sync automatically. Squarespace manages your DNS, so you have to manually tell it where to point. Cloudflare doesn't control your domain's DNS unless you transfer your nameservers to Cloudflare entirely.

When you added your custom domain in Cloudflare Pages, it should have shown you a CNAME record to add. Go back to your Cloudflare Pages project → Custom domains and it'll tell you the exact value. Then add that as a CNAME record in Squarespace like I described above.

Alternatively, you could transfer your nameservers to Cloudflare (which gives Cloudflare full DNS control and makes things simpler going forward), but the CNAME approach is quicker for now.

I did that with the nameservers - I still have to do this?

Feb 17

Clarified that nameserver transfer necessitates separate DNS configuration
Clarified that nameserver transfer necessitates separate DNS configuration


If you already pointed your nameservers to Cloudflare, then forget Squarespace — Cloudflare controls your DNS now. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard:

Click on your domain (not the Pages project — the domain itself, under Websites)
Go to DNS → Records
Add a CNAME: Name = @, Target = personal-site.pages.dev
Add another CNAME: Name = www, Target = personal-site.pages.dev
Delete any old records pointing to Squarespace if they carried over
It might take a few minutes for the nameserver change to fully propagate, but once it does your domain should point to your site.
